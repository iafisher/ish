`ish` is a concept for a new kind of [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) that combines the benefits of textual and graphical user interfaces.

Building `ish` requires [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://guide.elm-lang.org/install/elm.html) to get Elm for your platform.

Once Elm is installed, build `ish` like this:

```shell
elm make src/Main.elm --output=dist/bundle.js
```

Then, open `public/index.html` in a web browser.
